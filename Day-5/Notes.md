# Data types in Terraform

The Terraform language uses the following types for its values:

* string: A sequence of characters representing some text like "hello"
* number: A numeric value. The number datatype can represent both whole numbers like 15 and fractional values like 6.2839293
* bool: A boolean value, either true or false. bool values can be used in conditional logic.
* list(or tuple): A sequence of values like ["us-west-1a", "us-west-1c"]. Elements in a list or tuple are identified by consecutive whole numbers starting with zero
* map(or object): A group lo values identified by names labels, like (name = "Narender", age = 54)

Strings, numbers and bools are sometimes called as primitive data types. Lists/tuples and maps/objects are sometimes called complex types, structural types or collection types.
